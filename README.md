# Hierarchical Peak Finding

The file [hierarchical_peaks.py](hierarchical_peaks.py) is a Python module for detecting peaks in numeric data. It contains algorithms for building and searching a hierarchical tree, corresponding to smaller peaks merging into larger peaks at increasing scales. It is very suitable for analyzing fractal-like peaks, as well as smooth peaks.

Requires Python 3.7+
