"""Python module containing tools and utilities.

The class ChainedAttributes is a base class for writing classes
that can add functionality to objects at runtime,
which is then called via a new attribute.
(A kind of decorator design pattern.)

Usage examples:
---------------

Create a naive object:

>>> class Student:
...     pass
...
>>> student1 = Student()

Give it an external object as a new attribute:

>>> class Degree(ChainedAttributes):
...     pass
...
>>> degree1 = Degree().setattr(student1)
>>> student1.degree == degree1
True

Extend with a chained attribute:

>>> degree2 = Degree().setattr(student1.degree, attrname="higher_degree")
>>> student1.degree.higher_degree == degree2
True

The external objects access the original instance as 'rootself':

>>> student1.degree.rootself == student1
True
>>> student1.degree.higher_degree.rootself == student1
True

Make the object naive again:

>>> student1.degree.delattr()
>>> hasattr(student1, "degree")
False
