"""Python module for testing.

Collection of assertion functions for use in testing.

Two of the functions assert equality between objects.
The other 19 functions assert expected tree properties.
Input to the each of these is either a Tree or a HyperTree object.

Usage examples:
---------------

>>> import peakoscope
>>> data = [10, 30, 40, 30, 10, 50, 70, 70, 50, 80]
>>> tree = peakoscope.tree(data)
>>> assert_iteration_produces_members(tree)
>>> assert_leafs_have_no_children_and_root_has_no_parent(tree)
>>> assert_parent_and_children_are_inverse_of_each_other(tree)
>>> assert_level_is_length_of_root_path(tree)
>>> assert_root_is_outermost_and_leafs_are_innermost(tree)
